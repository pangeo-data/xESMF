What's new
==========

0.4.x (01-10-2020)
------------------
The git repo is now hosted by pangeo-data (https://github.com/pangeo-data/xESMF)

Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* By default, weights are not written to disk, but instead kept in memory.
* Installation requires ESMPy 8.0.0 and up.

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
* The `Regridder` object now takes a `weights` argument accepting a scipy.sparse COO matrix,
  a dictionary, an xarray.Dataset, or a path to a netCDF file created by ESMF. If None, weights
  are computed and can be written to disk using the `to_netcdf` method. This `weights` parameter
  replaces the `filename` and `reuse_weights` arguments, which are preserved for backward compatibility (:pull:`3`).
  By `David Huard <https://github.com/huard>`_ and `Raphael Dussin <https://github.com/raphaeldussin>`_
* Added documentation discussion how to compute weights from a shell using MPI, and reuse from xESMF (:pull:`12`).
  By `Raphael Dussin <https://github.com/raphaeldussin>`_
* Add support for masks in :py:func`esmf_grid`. This avoid NaNs to bleed into the interpolated values.
  When using a mask and the `conservative` regridding method, use a new method called
  `conservative_normed` to properly handle normalization (:pull:`1`).

0.3.0 (06-03-2020)
------------------

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Add support for `ESMF.LocStream` `(#81) <https://github.com/JiaweiZhuang/xESMF/pull/81>`_
  By `Raphael Dussin <https://github.com/raphaeldussin>`_


0.2.2 (07-10-2019)
------------------

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Add option to allow degenerated grid cells `(#61) <https://github.com/JiaweiZhuang/xESMF/pull/61>`_
  By `Jiawei Zhuang <https://github.com/JiaweiZhuang>`_


0.2.0 (04-08-2019)
------------------

Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
All user-facing APIs in v0.1.x should still work exactly the same. That said, because some internal codes have changed a lot, there might be unexpected edge cases that break current user code. If that happens, you can revert to the previous version by `pip install xesmf==0.1.2` and follow `old docs <https://xesmf.readthedocs.io/en/v0.1.2/>`_.

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Lazy evaluation on dask arrays (uses :py:func:`xarray.apply_ufunc` and :py:func:`dask.array.map_blocks`)
* Automatic looping over variables in an xarray Dataset
* Add tutorial notebooks on those new features

0.1.2 (03-08-2019)
------------------
This release mostly contains internal clean-ups to facilitate future development.

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Deprecates `regridder.A` in favor of `regridder.weights`
* Speed-up test suites by using coarser grids
* Use parameterized tests when appropriate
* Fix small memory leaks from `ESMF.Grid`
* Properly assert ESMF enums

0.1.1 (31-12-2017)
------------------
Initial release.
